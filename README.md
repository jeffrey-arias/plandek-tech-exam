1. Clone this repo
2. Ensure that you have the [requirements](#requirements) to run it
3. [Check](#checking-that-it-works) that it works properly
4. [Code the Exercise](#exercise)

## Requirements

To run this test we need:

- [node 14.x](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [yarn 1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) (although it could be changed to use an alternative like `npm`)

## Checking that it works

### Preparing the UI to run

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn type-check`: this will run the TypeScript compilation check
3. `yarn fix`: this will run `prettier` and `eslint`, which should run without any warnings
4. `yarn test`: this will run the test suite (`jest`)
5. `yarn dev`: this will run the UI in <http://localhost:3000>

## Exercise

Open `App.tsx` file. The challenge is described there.
